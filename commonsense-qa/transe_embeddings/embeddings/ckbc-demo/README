This is the README for the commonsense knowledge base completion demo.

This program demonstrates the Bilinear AVG model developed and trained for commonsense knowledge base completion by Xiang Li, Aynaz Taheri, Lifu Tu, and Kevin Gimpel (ACL 2016).

Example Command:
python demo_bilinear.py drive_fast accident topfive
(requires numpy)

which should output the following:
causes score: 0.992529380836
hassubevent score: 0.986317631007
hasprerequisite score: 0.248943002166
usedfor score: 0.160948880494
hasfirstsubevent score: 0.160748517657

The demo outputs tuple scores for the given left term and right term on the 
commandline (use underscore to indicate a space for multi-word terms), where 
the last argument is the kind of relation you want reported:

max: outputs the max scoring of all relations
sum: outputs the sum of scores of all relations (useful if you only need a general relatedness score for two terms)
all: outputs scores for all relations, sorted by score
topfive: outputs scores for the top five highest-scoring relations
{relation_name}: for a specific relation name (e.g., "Causes"), outputs score for the tuple with that relation

Note: not all relations in ConceptNet are supported by this demo; the rarest relations are omitted because there is not enough data to learn from for them.
